# `nt`
_Note taking system in Bash_

## What is `nt`?

`nt` is just a small collection of scripts that I use for note-taking for personal/professional work. The main purpose of these scripts was to learn a little bit of Bash and finding a useful application for it.
I mainly write in markdown when taking notes and want to maintain a set of scripts for automating tasks like creating new daily notes, new templates or using git.

## Can I use your scripts?

Yeah go for it! I don't mind, I think they're pretty neat and if you enjoy working in the terminal with tools like Vim then it can be a nice addition to your workflow.
